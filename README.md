## 2D Reconfigurable Memory Device Enabled by DefectEngineering for Multifunctional Neuromorphic Computing


In this era of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things, emerging new computing
paradigms such as in-sensor and in-memory computing call for both
structurally simple and multifunctional memory devices. Although emerging
two-dimensional (2D) memory devices provide promising solutions, the most
reported devices either suffer from single functionalities or structural complexity.
Here, this work reports a reconfigurable memory device (RMD) based
on MoS2/CuInP2S6 heterostructure, which integrates the defect engineeringenabled
interlayer defects and the ferroelectric polarization in CuInP2S6, to realize
a simplified structure device for all-in-one sensing, memory and computing.
The plasma treatment-induced defect engineering of the CuInP2S6 nanosheet
effectively increases the interlayer defect density, which significantly enhances
the charge-trapping ability in synergy with ferroelectric properties. The reported
device not only can serve as a non-volatile electronic memory device, but also
can be reconfigured into optoelectronic memory mode or synaptic mode after
controlling the ferroelectric polarization states in CuInP2S6. When operated in
optoelectronic memory mode, the all-in-one RMD could diagnose ophthalmic
disease by segmenting vasculature within biological retinas. On the other
hand, operating as an optoelectronic synapse, this work showcases in-sensor
reservoir computing for gesture recognition with high energy efficiency.
